# Charity: Water x Global Career Accelerator Landing Page

This is a learning project aimed to design a professional landing page for a non-profit organization.

In this project, I learned and practiced front-end design skills from the Global Career Accelerator Internship program.
I used tools such as Canva, and AI (ChatGPT and Copilot) to create this project with HTML/CSS in an efficient workflow.
